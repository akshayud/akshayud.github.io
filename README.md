## Something about me

I am currently in my first year of graduate studies at the University of Delaware in Newark,DE . My current major is Computer Engineering.Last semester my major focussed on courses in Cybersecurity, and an Computer Architecture course. My Undergrad major was Electronics Engineering. This page will give you a comprehensive overview of all my projects. 

## Web Application Security Projects

Web Application Security was one of the courses in which I got to do some awesome projects. These were basically Web Development kind of projects with an added security aspect.

### Project 1 : Text Twist Clone

In this project, we built a scrabble like game using PHP, HTML and CSS. The development process involved providing the player with a jumbled set of words and then comparing every guess the player makes with words in an SQLite databse. My role was to assist with the PHP script for fetching and comparing words from the database as well as styling the page. The source code can be found here [Code on Github](https://github.com/akshay9594/Text-twist)
