## __HPC Lab at the University of Delaware__ 
Lab Website - (https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~eigenman/research.html)

I was a part of the HPC Lab at UD headed by Prof. [Rudi Eigenmann](https://www.ece.udel.edu/people/faculty/eigenman/). I did my PhD being part of this lab.

## __Internships__ 
At the [Pacific Northwest National Lab](https://www.pnnl.gov)

In this project we implemented a Python frontend for a Domain Specific Compiler base on [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org) for Computational Chemistry applications. The compiler is called [COMET](https://github.com/pnnl/COMET). 


## __Past Research__

### [Advanced Compiler Analysis Techniques for Irregular Computations](http://subscripted-subscript.akshayud.me/)

Implemented an Analysis technique and extended the related Dependence Test for compile-time automatic parallelization of Subscripted Subscript patterns using the [Cetus](https://sites.udel.edu/cetus-cid/) Source to Source translator which translates from C to C annoted with OpenMP. Details in the publications listed above.
