# Something about me

I am currently working towards my PhD at the University of Delaware in Newark,DE . My major is Computer Engineering.My Undergrad major was Electronics Engineering. I have completed coursework in a variety of areas ranging from web application security, computer architecture, secure software design to parallel programming, compilers , ML and cryptography. This page will give you a comprehensive overview of all my work.


## Current Research

My current research involves compilers, more specifically compilers for autoparallelization. I work with the Cetus Source to Source translator which translates from C to C annoted with OpenMP. I want to make Cetus as powerful as possible through the use of even more sophisticated techniques. Current challenge is to develop a compiler technique for the automatic parallelization of subscripted subscripts. Details about this project and current progress can be found at [link](http://subscripted-subscript.akshayud.me/)

## Web Application Security Projects
Building applications using PHP, HTML and javascript. Emphasis was on building secure applications for the we. Follo this [link](http://webappsecurity.akshayud.me/) for detailed overview of all the projects.
