###### 1. Speculative Task-Parallelization

<div style="display: inline-block;font-family: 'Helvetica';font-size:18px;">The ParaSol project funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) UK, seeks to develop compiler analyses and transformations to extract parallelism for future processors. I successfully implemented optimization techniques (in C++) to take advantage of and improve instruction-level parallelism for efficient speculative execution of application codes. The techniques have been incorporated into the ParaSol compiler, developed using the industry standard LLVM infrastructure.</div>

###### 2. Software Prefetching

<div style="display: inline-block;font-family: 'Helvetica';font-size:18px;">Implemented a compiler transformation pass (in LLVM) to automatically extract helper thread for prefetching data in a Simultaneous Multi-threading (SMT) execution context. <a href="https://github.com/CompArchCam/GhostThreadingCompiler/tree/release/20.x">Project on GitHub</a>.</div>

###### 3. Automatic Parallelization of Irregular Computations

<div style="display: inline-block;font-family: 'Helvetica';font-size:18px;">Implemented an Analysis technique and extended the related Dependence Test for compile-time automatic parallelization of Subscripted Subscript patterns using the
